# Flask-MongoDB-RabbitMQ

The general idea of this project:

‣There are several microservices.

‣They communicate with each other using RabbitMQ.

‣The first microservice provides REST API for communication as well as MongoDB.

‣The second microservice generates a random movement of the car and controls compliance with all the rules.

The work on the project has not been completed. There are several bugs in the code. Namely, there is no system for monitoring the start and end of trips. In order to delete unnecessary records from the Database.
